      He is vice-president of the UMONS research institute INFORTECH and active member of research institutes COMPLEXYS and NUMEDIART.
      His main research interests are empirical analysis and tools for software evolution, software quality, software modelling and software ecosystems.
      He published countless scientific articles on the aforementioned research topics in peer-reviewed international journals, conferences and workshops.
      He was program chair of ICSM 2013, CSMR 2012 and CSMR 2011.
      He was keynote speaker for ICSME 2016. He co-organised numerous scientific workshops.
      He was program committee member and reviewer of numerous international journals, conferences and workshops related to software engineering, software modelling and software evolution.
      He is former director of the ERCIM Working Group on Software Evolution and the ESF Research Network RELEASE.
      He coordinated the project <a href="http://informatique.umons.ac.be/genlog/projects/ecos/">Ecological Studies of Open Source Software Ecosystems (ECOS)</a>
      and is principal investigator of the collaborative research project <a href="https://secohealth.github.io">Towards an interdisciplinary, socio-technical methodology and analysis of the health of software ecosystems (SECOHealth)</a>
      He co-edited the Springer books <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540764397">Software Evolution</a> with S. Demeyer in 2008,
      and <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642453977">Evolving Software Systems</a> with A. Serebrenik and A. Cleve in 2014.

    <h4>Coen De Roover, Vrije Universiteit Brussel</h4>
    <img class="pull-left member-picture" src="assets/pictures/coen_deroover.png" />
    <p class="small">
      Coen De Roover is an associate professor at the Software Languages Lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium.
      The central theme of his research is the design of program analysis and transformation techniques, and their application in software engineering tools for quality assurance.
      Example analysis techniques include abstract interpretation of dynamically-typed programs in general, and of JavaScript programs in particular.
      Example tools include tools for detecting user-specified bug patterns in an implementation, or for validating an implementation with respect to a user-specified design.
      Here, an executable logic often serves as the tool’s specification language.

    <h4>Serge Demeyer, University of Antwerp</h4>
    <img class="pull-left member-picture" src="assets/pictures/serge_demeyer.png" />
    <p class="small">
      Serge Demeyer is a professor at the University of Antwerp and the spokesperson for the ANSYMO (Antwerp System Modelling) research group. He directs a research lab investigating the theme of "Software Reengineering" (LORE - Lab On REengineering). Serge Demeyer is a spokesperson for the NEXOR interdisciplinary research consortium and an affiliated member of the Flanders Make Research Centre.
      In 2007 he received a "Best Teachers Award" from the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Antwerp and is still very active in all matters related to teaching quality.
      His main research interest concerns software evolution, more specifically, how to strike the right balance between reliability (striving for perfection) and agility (optimising for improvements).
      He is an active member of the corresponding international research communities, serving in various conference organization and program committees.
      He has written a book entitled "Object-Oriented Reengineering" and edited a book on "Software Evolution".
      He also authored numerous peer reviewed articles, many of them in top conferences and journals.
      Serge Demeyer completed his M.Sc. in 1987 and his PhD in 1996, both at the "Vrije Universiteit Brussel".
      After his PhD, he worked for three years in Switzerland, where he served as a technical co-ordinator of a european research project.
      Switzerland remains near and dear to his heart, witness the sabbatical leave during 2009-2010 at the University of Zürich in the research group SEAL.
